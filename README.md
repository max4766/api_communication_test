# Introduction

This is a [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a demo web page(ETELAB) that gets data which is required for input components from an API server.

In this porject, `json-server` is used to make a fake server. 

It is possible to check if the value for the packet is correctly set and ready by an alert showing out after clicking search button.

In this project, `Axios` enables you to get data from the API Server(localhost:3000) for the web page(localhost:4000).

`MUI` is used for input form UI.

## Getting Started

API server port = 3000

demo web page port = 4000

First, copy this project's URL and clone this project into your local with git :

```bash
git clone [project URL]
```

FYI, No need to make a new folder for this project. 

it is already packed in the folder with it's project name when you clone.

Then, recover packages. update node_modules with the command below :

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server with the command below :

```bash
npm start
```

and those under are for different use (but we do not need those for now) :

```bash
npm run test # Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode #

npm run build # Builds the app for production to the build folder #

npm run eject # Remove the single build dependency from your project #

```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

Though you access, multiple error will be detected.

This is because API server (port 3000) is currently not working due to 

Maria DB, which is the database for the api server is no longer usable. 

The demo page will return 500 error.

Need to find a solution for this issue.

## About the source

- `src/minorCompoents/BasicButton.js` : Button component for `src/MajorCompoents/LabYearMonthSelectAndButton.js`.

This component gets parameter from `src/MajorCompoents/LabYearMonthSelectAndButton.js`.

- `src/minorCompoents/BasicSelect.js` : Select Input component for `src/MajorCompoents/LabYearMonthSelectAndButton.js`.

This component gets parameter from `src/MajorCompoents/LabYearMonthSelectAndButton.js`.

- `src/MajorCompoents/LabYearMonthSelectAndButton.js` : Component that uses both Button component and Select Input component.

This component defines functions with `useState`, `useEffect`, `axios`.

returns parameters and values to  both Button component and Select Input component.

All the components' file extension is .js

This is because .jsx is compatible with .js for jsx grammar is based on javascript.

You can convert .js sources' file extension into .jsx to clearify this is a React project.

## Goal

The goal of this project was `To apply UI library(MUI) into the React project and share data with an API server which is pre-loaded`.
